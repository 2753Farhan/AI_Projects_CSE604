## Key Implementation Features

### 1. Game Architecture
- **Board Size**: 10x10 grid.
- **Display**: 800x800 pixel window with centered 600x600 board.
- **Theme**: Cosmic aesthetic with animated starry background.
- **UI Elements**: Gradient effects, semi-transparent overlays, and enhanced visual feedback.

### 2. AI Implementation

#### Evaluation Function
The AI uses a weighted scoring system for game state evaluation:
- **Win condition (5 in a row)**: 100,000 points
- **Open four**: 50,000 points
- **Closed four**: 10,000 points
- **Open three**: 5,000 points
- **Closed three**: 1,000 points
- **Blocking opponent's three**: 7,500 points
- **Open two**: 500 points
- **Closed two**: 100 points

##### Additional Scoring Factors
- Position bonuses based on distance from center.
- Multipliers for recognizing opponent threats.
- Pattern recognition for open-ended sequences.

### 3. Search Algorithm
- **Algorithm**: Minimax with alpha-beta pruning.
- **Depth**: Searches up to 3 moves deep.
- **Move Ordering**: Prioritizes moves adjacent to existing stones.
- **Pruning Optimization**: Alpha-beta boundaries to reduce search space efficiently.

### 4. UI/UX Considerations
- **Real-time stone placement preview**.
- **Two-player mode** for human vs. human play.
- **Animated star background** enhances immersion.
- **Winning line visualization** for game clarity.
- **Game Over screen** with replay options.

### 5. Technical Optimizations
- **Frame Rate**: Capped at 60 FPS for smooth performance.
- **Efficient Board Management**: 2D arrays for optimized state handling.
- **Smart Move Generation**: Focuses on moves adjacent to stones.
- **Memory-Efficient Pattern Detection**: Improved performance for large searches.
